## Requirements
[ ] Upload transactions from all bank acconunts into application to understand the total history
[ ] See all transactions from which account and make sure they're not duplicates


## User stories

[ ] View all transactions
[ ] Bulk apply categories to different transactions, with the option of skipping categories that are manually set
[ ] Be able to view category spending breakdown based on date ranges


## What to AVOID
- I don't want to have to build every single fucking part of this from scratch. I need basic numbers, a basic UI, and that's it.


The different objects
- Transactions
- Transaction Categories
    - CategoryPattern
    - Balance

- Reports

- Transaction Name Patterns



## Abstract
I've tried building this before with varios scrapres and account actiivyt dat, the hard part is getting all of the fucking data together and knowing which transactions are what and which ones to ignore.
